# Next.js 15 Production Deployment Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 where an application renders correctly in development but fails in production. The application produces a blank page or an error. The issue is isolated to production builds and does not occur during development.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` (The app should work correctly)
4. Run `npm run build` followed by `npm run start` (The app will show an unexpected issue). 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring your Next.js application is correctly configured for production, and verifying that any necessary environment variables are set up properly.  This could involve checking server-side code and API routes for potential errors that only manifest in the production environment. Additionally, review any custom middleware to check for configuration errors or unintended behavior.
